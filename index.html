  <p> My favourite hobby is CODING! Coding has been my passion and now I will try to make it my profession. This journey started form whitehatejr! You know I am able to create this web page only because of two things which is my coding teacher and coding. In starting it was very hard to understand things but my teacher made it more easier for me and now I am here! From this hobbie I have actually become problem solving and a thinker. I have started loving coding because of my teacher! She have put a lot of hard work to teach me coding and now I will try to take it to the top! I dont like coding but love it now.
